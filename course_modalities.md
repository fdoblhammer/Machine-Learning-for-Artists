# Course Modalities

For a successful completion of the course, i would need you to hand in a small ML Project. You can choose between 3 types of projects.

## Option 1: A custom YOLO Detector

Create a dataset of one (or multiple different) objects of your choosing you want to detect. Try to avoid classes that already exist within the YOLO framework. Label your data and train a detector. The base mark for a working classification is normally ~800 images per class, but it can be less â€“ if it works reliably. 

Hand in your dataset by uploading it to the owncloud folder. When you've handed in your work write me an email with a short description of what the classifier should be capable of and where i can find it/what its called. 

If I cannot access the to be detected object, add videos of the object, so i can test it properly.

## Option 2: A small (displaced) application

Hand in documentation of a small project you did with a predifined model. For this you could choose either YOLO, DeepFace, MediaPipe, Whisper or combinations. This project should critically reflect on the way such algorithm work. This could be done through misusing or displacing the algorithms. 

Document your results and upload them to the Owncloud. When you've handed in your work write me an email with a short description.

## Option 3: Get some other ML-Application to work

Please write me an email of what your planning to do.
