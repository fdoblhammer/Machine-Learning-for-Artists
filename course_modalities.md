# Course Modalities

For a successful completion of the course, i would need you to hand in a small ML Project. You can choose between 3 types of projects.

## Option 1: A custom YOLO Detector

Create a dataset of one or more objects that you want to detect. Avoid classes that already exist within the YOLO framework. Label your data and train a detector. The standard requirement for a reliable classification is typically ~800 images per class, though fewer may suffice.

Submit your dataset by uploading it to the OwnCloud folder. After submitting your work, email me a brief description of the classifier's capabilities and how to access it.

If I cannot access the object to be detected, add videos of the object so I can test it properly.

## Option 2: A small (displaced) application

Submit documentation of a small project that you completed using a predefined model. You may choose from YOLO, DeepFace, MediaPipe, Whisper, or any combination of these. This project should critically reflect on how such algorithms work. You could do this by misusing or displacing the algorithms.

Document your results and upload them to Owncloud. After submitting your work, email me a brief description.

## Option 3: Get some other ML-Application to work

Please write me an email of what your planning to do.
